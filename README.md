In-Memory File System

This repository contains a simple implementation of an in-memory file system in Python, providing essential file operations through a command-line interface.

Features
Directory Operations:

Create directories with mkdir
Navigate directories with cd
List directory contents with ls
File Operations:

Create empty files with touch
Display file contents with cat
Move files/directories with mv
Copy files/directories with cp
Remove files/directories with rm
State Management:

Save and load file system state using save_state and load_state
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python filesystem.py
Interact with the file system using commands like mkdir, cd, ls, touch, mv, cp, rm, and optionally save_state/load_state.

Requirements
Python installed on your system.
Notes
Refer to the code comments and docstrings for implementation details.
Ensure to handle errors and invalid inputs gracefully during usage.
Customize and extend the code based on specific project requirements.
Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this in-memory file system implementation!
